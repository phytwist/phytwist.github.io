              <p class="paragraph">  1. Identify the reactants in your chemical reaction. These reactants are represented by [A] and [B] in the formula.
            </p><p class="paragraph">2. Determine the order of the reaction with respect to each reactant. The orders are represented by the exponents m and n in the formula. The order of a reaction can be determined experimentally by observing how changing the concentration of a reactant affects the rate of the reaction.
            </p><p class="paragraph">3. Determine the rate constant, k. The rate constant is specific to the reaction at a given temperature and can be determined experimentally. It quantifies the speed of the reaction.
            </p><p class="paragraph"> 4. Measure or determine the initial concentrations of the reactants, [A] and [B].
            </p><p class="paragraph"> 5. Substitute the values of [A], [B], m, n, and k into the formula for rate. Calculate the rate of the reaction using the given concentrations and the rate constant.
            </p><p class="paragraph"> 6. The rate of the reaction represents the speed at which the reactants are being consumed or the products are being formed. It is typically expressed in units of concentration per unit time (e.g., mol/L·s).  </p>

            <br><br><br><div class="info"><h3>Coulomb’s Law</h3></div> Formula: <br>

            F= k |q^1 q^2|d^2 <br>
            k=9×10^9 Nm^2/ c^2
            
            <p class="paragraph"> 1: Identify the charges of the objects (q1 and q2) and the distance between them (r) in the problem.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">2: Use the formula:F= k |q1 q2|d2</p>
             <p class="paragraph"> ▪︎F is the force between the charges,</p>
             <p class="paragraph"> ▪︎k is Coulomb's constant, with a value of 9×10⁹ Nm²/C²</p>
           <p class="paragraph">  ▪︎q1 and q2 are the charges of the objects,</p>
           <p class="paragraph">  ▪︎r is the distance between the charges</p>
            <p class="paragraph">  3: Plug in the values of the charges and distance into the formula, along with the value of Coulomb's constant.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">  4: Perform the calculations to find the force between the charges.</p>
           

          <br><br><br><div class="info"><h3>Electric Field</h3></div> Formula: E= F/q     <br>

          <p class="paragraph">1. Determine the magnitude of the electric force acting on the charge Q. </p>
            <p class="paragraph"> 2. Measure the charge's magnitude by Q. </p>
            <p class="paragraph">3. To obtain the power of the field at this point, multiply the electrical force by the charge's magnitude.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">It should be noted that the electric field strength at a point in space changes, depending on whether there is additional charge or electricity fields. Therefore, only a specific point in space and under certain conditions is subject to the formula E = Fq.</p>
          <br>
            <p class="paragraph">E= kq/d^2</p>
            <br>
           <p class="paragraph">1. Determine the size of the charge Q which gives rise to an electrical field. </p>
           <p class="paragraph">2. The distance between the point in space and the charge Q must be determined. </p>
           <p class="paragraph">3. To calculate the electrical field strength at that point, insert values of k, q, and d in the formula.</p>
          <br> <p class="paragraph">It is crucial to remember that the formula E = kq/d2 only applies to point charges, in which the charge's magnitude is insignificant with the distance between the charge and the location in space where the electric field is being measured.</p>
          

          <br><br><br><div class="info"><h3>Electric Flux</h3></div> Formula:  ΦE=EA       E=EScosθ

          <p class="paragraph"> 2: Use the formula E=Escosθ to calculate the electric field strength.</p>
            <p class="paragraph"> 3: Substitute the expression for electric field strength (E=Escosθ) into the formula Φ=E.A to get Φ= Escosθ . A</p>


            <br><br><br><div class="info"><h3> Gauss Law  </h3></div> Formula: ∮ E · dA = Q / ε₀ <br>
<p class="paragraph"> 1. Identify the closed surface over which you want to calculate the electric flux. This surface can be any closed surface, such as a sphere, cube, or cylinder.</p>
<p class="paragraph">2. Determine the total charge enclosed by the closed surface, represented by Q. This can be the net charge or the sum of all charges within the closed surface.</p>
<p class="paragraph">3. Calculate the electric flux (∮ E · dA) through the closed surface. This involves taking the dot product of the electric field vector (E) and the area vector (dA) for each small area element on the surface, and summing up these dot products over the entire surface. This flux represents the total electric field passing through the surface.</p>
<p class="paragraph"> 4. Determine the value of the electric constant, ε₀. The electric constant, also known as the permittivity of free space, has a value of approximately 8.85 × 10^(-12) C^2/Nm^2.</p>
<p class="paragraph"> 5. Substitute the values of Q and ε₀ into the formula and solve for the electric field (E). This will give you the magnitude and direction of the electric field at any point on the closed surface.
